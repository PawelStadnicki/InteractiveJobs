# Interactive Jobs

Searching for an IT job can be an exhilarating adventure, but traditional job boards often lack the excitement factor.

Interactive Jobs goes beyond simply presenting job offers. It serves as a municipal portal, empowering you to explore the most fitting locations and city amenities for yourself, your family, friends, colleagues, or any other group.

Integrated with Polyglot Notebook, Interactive Jobs allows users to query job offers within their city's context, leveraging their preferred programming language.
